# Rails + React

Experimental, no style or form validations.

Rails evolution since version 3.x is not profound, as far as I could tell, but it's still a fast way to ship code and a stable way to build an api/data store.

React gem does not support the latest versions of React including 16.7 (hooks), which means more lines of code, but overall the two work pretty seamlessly. 

# Todo:

Add hot code reload if it exists
